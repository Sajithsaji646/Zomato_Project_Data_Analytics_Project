# 🍽️ Zomato-like Food Ordering & Data Analytics Web App

This project is a full-stack simulation of a food ordering platform inspired by Zomato, combined with backend data analytics to extract real-time business insights. It demonstrates how orders flow from the frontend to the backend, how data is stored, and how meaningful metrics are derived using Python and SQL.
